# Flaskify: Modular Multi-Service Blog Application

This project is a **Deployable Multi-Service Application** designed using Flask, which demonstrates a modular architecture with three distinct microservices: **User Service**, **Blog Service**, and **Comment Service**. 

Read all details of this project here: 

1. The **User Service** handles user registration and login functionality using JWT-based authentication.  
2. The **Blog Service** allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts.  
3. The **Comment Service** facilitates adding and managing comments linked to specific blog posts.

Each service operates independently, using Flask and SQLite for lightweight backend management. HTML templates and Flaskâ€™s routing system provide a simple yet interactive user interface. The services communicate seamlessly, ensuring a smooth workflow between user authentication, blog creation, and commenting.

This project showcases fundamental concepts of microservices, REST APIs, and database operations, making it an excellent example for learning scalable, modular application development. It is ideal for beginners exploring multi-service architectures and their integration.
